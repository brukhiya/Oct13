            <h2>What is Biryani??</h2>
            <p>Biryani is a mixed rice dish originating among the Muslims of South Asia. It is made with spices, vegetables, rice, and usually some type of meat. In some cases without any meat, and sometimes with eggs and potatoes. It is usually served with dahi chutney or raita, a sour dish of aubergine (brinjal), boiled egg, and salad.</p>
            <p> It is one of the most popular dishes in South Asia, as well as among the diaspora from the region. Similar dishes are also prepared in other parts of the world such as in Iraq, Myanmar, Thailand, and Malaysia. Biryani is the single most-ordered dish on Indian online food ordering and delivery services, and has been labelled as the most popular dish overall in India.</p>
            <p>It known for its aroma and flavor. Fresh herbs, saffron, and basmati rice give it a sweet-floral aroma that hits the nose before you taste it. Whole garam masala, fried onions, and marinated meat provide warmth and subtle heat to the dish. </p>
            <p>The Indian subcontinent has a history of foreign rulers, with each ruler introducing the country to various cultures and traditions as well as cuisines. The Turks, Afghans, Persians, and Arabs have left behind a rich culture of foods and feasts, while the Europeans have introduced the country to the popular vegetables such as potatoes and tomatoes. Even the tea we swear by had been growing wild in the northeast until the Britishers started its commercial production. Staking the claim to fame loudest among all such dishes is biryani.</p>

            <h2>Origin of Biryani</h2>
            <p>The exact origin of Biryani is uncertain. In North India, different varieties of biryani developed in the Muslim centres of Delhi (Mughlai cuisine), Rampur, Lucknow (Awadhi cuisine) and other small principalities. In South India, where rice is more widely used as a staple food, several distinct varieties of biryani emerged from Hyderabad Deccan (where some believe the dish originated) as well as Tamil Nadu (Ambur, Thanjavur, Chettinad, Salem, Dindigal), Kerala (Malabar), Telangana, and Karnataka where Muslim communities were present.</p>
            <p>According to Pratibha Karan, who wrote the book Biryani, biryani is of Mughal origin, derived from pilaf varieties brought to the Indian subcontinent by Arab traders. She speculates that the pulao was an army dish in medieval India. Armies would prepare a one-pot dish of rice with whichever meat was available. Over time, the dish became biryani due to different methods of cooking, with the distinction between "pulao" and "biryani" being arbitrary.</p>
            <p>Another theory claims that the dish was prepared in India before the first Mughal emperor Babur conquered India. The 16th-century Mughal text Ain-i-Akbari makes no distinction between biryanis and pilaf (or pulao): it states that the word "biryani" is of older usage in India. A similar theory, that biryani came to India with Timur's invasion, appears to be incorrect because there is no record of biryani having existed in his native land during that period.</p>
            <p>According to the stats released by the topmost online food ordering apps, biryani is the most-ordered food in India. As per the data published by Swiggy, in 2022, 2.28 biriyanis were ordered every second. Also, the data from Zomato reveals that 186 biriyanis are delivered every minute across the country.</p>

            <h2>What makes a Biryani, Biryani??</h2>
    
            <p>Ingredients for biryani vary according to the region and the type of meat and vegetables used.
            Meat (chicken, goat, beef, lamb, prawn or fish) is the prime ingredient with rice.</p>
            <p>As is common in dishes of the Indian subcontinent, vegetables are sometimes also used when preparing biryani.
            Navratan biryani tends to use sweeter, richer ingredients such as cashews and raisins (kismis).</p>
    
            <p>The spices and condiments used in biryani may include fennel seeds, ghee (clarified butter), nutmeg, mace, pepper, cloves, cardamom, cinnamon, bay leaves, coriander, mint, ginger, onions, tomatoes, green chilies, and garlic.</p>
            <p>The premium varieties include saffron.</p>
    
            <p>The main ingredient that usually accompanies the spices is chicken or goat meat; special varieties might use beef or seafood instead.</p>
            <p>The dish may be served with dahi chutney or raita, korma, curry, a sour dish of aubergine (brinjal), boiled egg, and salad.</p>
